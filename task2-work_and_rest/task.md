## task 2 - Work and Rest

# Intro

Web development is not only about online shops, social media and static websites. Web is a powerfull platform for creating enterprise applications and services. 
In this task you will create something that makes you stand out from the rest. This task is a clear solution to problems some companies may encounter. It is a real life problem in the Industrial Sector. 

# Prerequisites

For factories, ships and other industrial sectors it is very important to record Work and Rest hours, so managers can plan work accordingly, reduce fatigue and improve safety. Let's build such an app.

# Task 

Only with frontend build an app, so user can fill in his work and rest hours. Run checks to comply with industry regulations and warn if something is wrong.

- Not required to make all 30 days, two weeks is enough
- Each day has to be split in 24 hours and each hour in 15 mins
- Style to your liking, but make sure violations are clearly indicated
- Check user's enrty against the following rules:
    - Not more than 14 work hours a day
    - Not more than 3 days in a row with 14 work hours
    - At least 6 hours of consecutive rest a day
    - Not less then 70 hours of rest in a week
- Highlight in red (or preferred colour) hours of day, which lead to violation of regulations
- Save user data in Browser cache, so it is accessible on the next visit

# Bonus points
Make a backend or use no-backend services to store user data in database.
